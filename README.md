# üê∂ Pet Adoption Platform
# peddy- template

A web application that allows users to view, like, and adopt pets. It provides an intuitive user interface for browsing pets by category and viewing detailed information about each pet.

## *Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features

1. **Category-based Pet Filtering**: Users can filter pets based on categories and see pets belonging to specific groups.
2. **Pet Cards**: Each pet is displayed on a card that shows details like the breed, date of birth, gender, and price.
3. **Adopt Pets**: Users can adopt pets by clicking the "Adopt" button on a pet card, which triggers an adoption modal with a countdown timer.
4. **Like Pets**: Users can 'like' pets, adding them to a liked pets section with thumbnail views.
5. **Sort by Price**: Pets can be sorted by price in descending order, allowing users to view the highest-priced pets first.

##  ES6 Features Used

1. **Async/Await**: Asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, are handled with `async` and `await` for better readability and flow control.
2. **Template Literals**: Used to dynamically insert pet data into HTML strings for rendering cards.
3. **Arrow Functions**: Clean syntax for defining concise functions, especially for event listeners and callbacks.
4. **Destructuring**: Extracting properties from objects like `petData` to directly access values such as `pet.image` and `pet.pet_name`.
5. **Spread Operator**: Used in various functions for manipulating and combining arrays and objects when handling pet data.
